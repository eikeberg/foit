## Challenges / Discusssions

###  Artchitecture team structure

How shall the archtectual involvement in enterprise team be done. 

### Access 
There is not a common way to access data in our area. We need to determend if we are going to use user as primary way of authentitate in an api or if system usser is the way 

#### System involved 
- Fusion
- ProCoSys
- SAP
- FAM
- SEMI
- STID

Need a workshop to set direction for access in our domain. Suggestion for participants: Eirik, Hans, Børje, Kennth, Vibeke, other?
Align with information owner to make sure we are on the right page

Existing philosophy:
    
    Fusion - Role based. Person is a part of a project and get access based on that, and what role she is enroled in (e.g. Electical Engineer, Project Director, QRM Manager)

    ProCoSys - Apply for access in AccessIT for a partcualar plant

    Fam


### Expectations to enterprise development teams

- Does this means more control and less mandate for an enterprise team
- Where is Trond in the new setup
- PO vs Architect
- Segregation of yellow and green architects


### Delegation of taks

### 

## Meetings
Should we have a regular meetings with 
- Stakeholder
- EA network
- Enterprise personnel
- Plant team
- etc.
